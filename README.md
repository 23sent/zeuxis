### Zeuxis - Software renderer

Zeuxis is a simple software renderer (rasterizer) written in Typescipt without any third-party library. It currently can render 3D triangle meshes (loadded from .obj files) to a pixel buffer and draws it to a HTML5 canvas. Complex shadings can be applied via shaders written in Typescript(or js).
